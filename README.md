# basic-express-site

Built using Node.js as part of the Odin Project Node course: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-basic-informational-site

A very basic informational site that contains 4 pages: index, about, contact-me and 404.

Created a node.js server file index.js and add the code needed to serve the right page according to the url.

localhost:8080 should take users to index.html
localhost:8080/about should take users to about.html
localhost:8080/contact-me should take users to contact-me.html
404.html will display any time the user tries to go to a page not listed above.
